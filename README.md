Business Analytics
==================

The goal of business analytics is to create value for the business by combining data, quantitative and qualitative methods, and business context to improve the effectiveness of problem-solving and decision-making.

Data Science
------------

Data mining and machine learning can be a powerful tools for business analytics to better understand customers and uncover patterns in relationships to increase revenue/decrease costs associated with serving the customer. Information gain from these patterns can then be applied to the business context of the problem and increase the profit of an organization.

Data science for business is about a systematic process for collecting and connecting the dots of business problems to tell a meaningful story that allows for its stakeholders to take action toward a solution.

Case Studies
------------

[Data Mining for Business Analytics (R Edition)](http://www.dataminingbook.com/) provides several case studies to explore using a business problem and a given dataset.

Each case study explored is listed below, along with the analytics tool and data science techniques used to add value to the business.

My recommended solutions are intended to deliver quick value for the organization with a process to scale as value is realized. The goal of each project is to understand the problem, theorize potential solutions given the data available, prototype various models, test the selected solution, and provide a plan for implementation of the learnings. The final output includes code for data scientists to read and written word for business users.
