# Business Analytics

The goal of business analytics is to create value for the business by
combining data, quantitative and qualitative methods, and business
context to improve the effectiveness of problem-solving and
decision-making.

## Data Science

Data mining and machine learning can be a powerful tools for business
analytics to better understand customers and uncover patterns in
relationships to increase revenue/decrease costs associated with serving
the customer. Information gain from these patterns can then be applied
to the business context of the problem and increase the profit of an
organization.

Data science for business is about a systematic process for collecting
and connecting the dots of business problems to tell a meaningful story
that allows for its stakeholders to take action toward a solution.

## Case Studies

[Data Mining for Business Analytics (R
Edition)](http://www.dataminingbook.com/) provides several case studies
to explore using a business problem and a given dataset.

Each case study explored is listed below, along with the analytics tool
and data science techniques used to add value to the business.

My recommended solutions are intended to deliver quick value for the
organization with a process to scale as value is realized. The goal of
each project is to understand the problem, theorize potential solutions
given the data available, prototype various models, test the selected
solution, and provide a plan for implementation of the learnings. The
final output includes code for data scientists to read and written word
for business
users.
